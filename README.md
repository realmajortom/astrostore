# AstroStore
A personal bookmark manager built with React, Node, &amp; MongoDB.  

## Introduction
As far as motivation goes, I designed the tool so I could access my bookmarks from any browser at any time, without depending one browser's proprietary sync tools. AstroStore also differentiates itself from other bookmarking tools with its whimsical personality--I like when apps make me smile. 

AstroStore doesn't request any identifying information from users. An account only requires a unique username and password--which is encrypted and securely stored in a NoSQL database.

## Technologies
- React w/ React Hooks.
  - I initially built the app with class components, but updated it with hooks to improve data congruency between dropdowns, collection lists, and favorites list.  
- Node server w/ Express framework
- REST APIs
- MongoDB  
- Google Cloud App Engine  

## Upcoming Features & Fixes
- Allow rearrangement of collections and bookmarks
- Dark mode
- Capability for users to delete their accounts and all corresponding bookmarks
