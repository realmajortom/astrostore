A cross-platform bookmark manager built with React, Node, &amp; MongoDB.

## Introduction
AstroStore is a tool to access and save bookmarks in any browser. The app is designed to work elegantly on both desktop and mobile--it can be installed as a standalone PWA on mobile, and desktop browser extensions are available for Chrome & Firefox. 

On top of awesome cross-platform functionality, AstroStore is mindful of user privacy. Zero identifying information is requested from users. An account only requires a unique username and password--which is encrypted and saved in an encrypted cloud database. There will also never be any trackers or ads on AstroStore because I hate that crap :)
